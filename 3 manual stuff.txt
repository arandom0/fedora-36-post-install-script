Tracker3 indexes files in your home directory, which is something I'm against and absolutely don't need in the fist place. Must use mask instead of fully disabling it, or system will break.

Run the two commands below, one after another:
systemctl --user mask tracker-extract-3.service tracker-miner-fs-3.service tracker-miner-rss-3.service tracker-writeback-3.service tracker-xdg-portal-3.service tracker-miner-fs-control-3.service
tracker3 reset -s -r

Then there is logs. Personally, I've never used them and don't have any need for them. The systemD - journalD service can generate a lot of logs, totalling many gigabites in space. It has limiters, based on your hard drive capacity, but I personally like to limit those even further. Instead of let's say, the max size being some percentage of your free space, I like to set it to a constant such as 512Mb.

The check how much space your logs currently take, run this command:
journalctl --disk-usage

To reduce the space, run the following command in the terminal:
sudo gnome-text-editor /etc/systemd/journald.conf

uncomment SystemMaxUse= and set it to equal to '512M' or less MBs if you want. It will look like this:
SystemMaxUse=512M
